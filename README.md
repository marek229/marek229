- 👋 Hi, I’m @marek229
- 👀 I’m interested in: Low-cost technical nerd-stuff (currently, i.e.: Different Linux Distros; Server/VM/VPN/Firewall/NAS - both Soft- and Hardware; Hi-fi; Smart Home; Network components + configuration; Android customization; and of course: Github :D);
MTB's (both riding and maintenance, upgrades etc.); Boxing; Weights training..
! Warning ! Editor's note:
Please stop reading at this point, if you want to skip some completely worthless, uninteresting, super-negative, and probably too intimate, plus out-of-place, personal information! Please.
If you have too much time, or are some kind of weirdo (in whatever kind of way - which I honestly don't care about - because I'm too busy and/or exhausted because of trying to repair/work on my own weirdness.. each f*cking day!), well.. then here you go: After my second disc protrusion (and other, still ongoing private/family-related tragic incidents), my level of motivation and having fun - at general - sank dramatically.. while "certain interests" came back (again..), with all the consequences I've already went through in the past. But, this isn't a psychiatric department and/or some kind of "self-help exchange.. thing" here, so please just forget everything after "weights-training" ;D
- 🌱 I’m currently learning useless and time-consuming stuff - see above!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, I suppose.. at least, currently..
- 📫 How to reach me - probably somehow on Github, I guess..
- 😄 Pronouns: Let's skip this.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Had no fun since the beginning of the second Corona-Lockdown in Germany. Not funny..? Hm. Then better stop reading here.
..otherwise: Fun, for example, in terms of: Social contacts; several quite important moments in life, of some of my best friends - which I've missed, as a result of the already mentioned piece of sh*t named "psychiatric department whatsoever thing"; the extensive dating after my breakup, which - of course not at a 100 percent rate - resulted in many, many wonderful moments (not only on a sexual level..); Well! I'm sorry - I think it's time to better stop now, again :/

But hey! Apart from that, I'm a funny, nice and honest guy.. Sometimes maybe a little bit sarcastic and/or cynical, which not everyone might be able to fully understand/interpret in certain kind of situations - at least, that's my impression (or I'm misinterpreting the whole situation because my thoughts have been wandering around in.. hostile territory, again!). 
Whatever! 

To be honest: I don't even know what I'm doing right now, and why I'm here. Well, I'll consider all that written c*ap as some kind of diary.. which I will forget about in a few minutes, as usually :)
